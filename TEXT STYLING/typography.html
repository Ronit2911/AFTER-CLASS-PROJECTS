        <p class="p1">Typography is the art and technique of arranging type (fonts, sizes, spacing, color) to make written language legible,
        readable, and visually appealing, enhancing communication by setting tone, creating hierarchy, and guiding the reader's
        eye through content, from ancient print to modern digital interfaces. </p>
