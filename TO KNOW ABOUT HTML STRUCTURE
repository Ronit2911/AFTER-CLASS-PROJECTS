    <h1>HTML Structure</h1>
    <p>
        HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create webpages. 
        It provides the basic structure of a website by using elements and tags to define different parts of a page such as text, images, and links. 
        HTML works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
        Every webpage you see on the internet is built using HTML as its foundation. 
        It helps browsers understand how to display content properly so users can read and interact with information online.
