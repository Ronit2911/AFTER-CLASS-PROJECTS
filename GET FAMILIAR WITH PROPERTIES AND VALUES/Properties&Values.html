       <p style="color: blue";> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a
    markup language like HTML. It is a fundamental technology for web development, working alongside HTML (which provides
    the structure and content) and JavaScript (which adds interactivity). CSS allows developers to control various aspects
    of a webpage's appearance, including colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and the positioning of elements. </p>
