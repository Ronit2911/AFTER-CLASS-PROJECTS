                <h2> SWIMMING </h2>
                <p> Swimming is a low-impact, full-body exercise for recreation, fitness, and competition. It involves propelling the body
                through water using combined arm and leg motions, working cardiovascular and muscular systems to build endurance and
                strength. Popular styles, or strokes, include freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. The buoyancy of water
                reduces stress on joints, making it ideal for individuals with joint conditions, and the activity also provides mental
                health benefits like stress reduction. </p>

                pitcher throwing a ball for the batter to hit with a bat. </p>
